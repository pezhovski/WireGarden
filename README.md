# About

This is my attemt to create a VPN server based on WireGuard with a flexible configuration, accessible  
through a web-based UI. The server will enable the creation of short-lived sessions for clients, support  
SSO authentication, and implement two-factor authentication for enhanced security.

# Motivation

The motivation behind this project stems from the need to provide remote access to team members using WireGuard,  
as the team grows in size. Managing individual WireGuard configurations for each team member becomes increasingly  
challenging and less secure over time. Additionally, it can be difficult for users to keep track of their  
configurations and manually update them when changes occur.

To address these issues, this project aims to simplify the configuration process and centralize control by providing  
a user-friendly web UI. By abstracting the underlying complexity, team members can easily connect to the VPN server  
without worrying about managing their configurations manually.
